  <h3>What is Git and why is it used?</h3><ul>
<li>Git is the most popular, open-source, widely used, and an example of distributed version control system (DVCS) used for handling the development of small and large projects in a more efficient and neat manner.</li>
<li>It is most suitable when there are multiple people working on projects as a team and is used for tracking the project changes and efficiently supports the collaboration of the development process.</li>
<li>With the help of the versioning system, the developer can identify who has made what changes and then run tests and fix bugs if any and then do necessary feature implementation. In case of any unforeseen circumstances, the code can be reverted to any of the previously working versions thereby saving huge efforts.</li>

<li>Due to a well-established version control system and the support for collaborative work, git has garnered wide popularity not just amongst the software developers, but also among the people who do other tasks like documentation or any other collaborative work. It can seem challenging at first, but once we get the hang of git, we find that it makes our lives much simpler.</li>
<li>It has an amazing branching system that supports nonlinear development along with keeping the developers accountable for their code. This helps in making the development process efficient and faster.</li>

            <p>The <code>git config</code> command is a convenient way to set configuration options for defining the behavior of the repository, user information and preferences, git installation-based configurations, and many such things. <br><br>For example:<br>To set up your name and email address before using git commands, we can run the below commands:</p><ul>
<li>git config --global<br>user.name<br>“&lt;&lt;your_name&gt;&gt;”<br> </li>

          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <ul>
<li>A <code>head</code> is nothing but a reference to the last commit object of a branch.</li>
<li>For every repository, there will always be a default head referred to as “master” or now “main” (as per GitHub) but there is no restriction to the count of heads available. In other words, it can have any number of heads.</li>
<li>
<strong>Usages:</strong><br><br>- To go or checkout to 1 commit before the latest commit, we use <code>git checkout HEAD~1</code><br><br>- To uncommit the last 3 commits without losing the changes, we first run <code>git reset HEAD~3</code>. Then we can see the changes made in the last 3 commits and then update it manually and commit it finally.<br><br>- In order to uncommit the last 3 commits and also remove the changes, we can run the command: <code>git reset --hard HEAD~3</code>. This command will completely remove all the changes.<br><br>- To look into the changes made in the last 3 commits, we can run <code>git diff HEAD~3</code><br><br>- To make a new commit by reverting the last 3 commits, we can run the command: <code>git revert --no-commit HEAD~3...HEAD</code>

          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <ul>
<li>Git usually handles feature merges automatically but sometimes while working in a team environment, there might be cases of conflicts such as:<br><br>1. When two separate branches have changes to the same line in a file<br>2. A file is deleted in one branch but has been modified in the other.<br> </li>
<li>These conflicts have to be solved manually after discussion with the team as git will not be able to predict what and whose changes have to be given precedence.</li>

        <section class="ibpage-article-header" id="why-is-git-easy-to-work-on">
          <h3>11. Why is it considered to be easy to work on Git?</h3>
          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <p>With the help of git, developers have gained many advantages in terms of performing the development process faster and in a more efficient manner. Some of the main features of git which has made it easier to work are:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Branching Capabilities:</strong><br><br>- Due to its sophisticated branching capabilities, developers can easily work on multiple branches for the different features of the project.<br>- It also has an easier merge option along with an efficient work-flow feature diagram for tracking it.<br> </li>
<li>
<strong>Distributed manner of development:</strong><br><br>- Git is a distributed system and due to this nature, it became easier to trace and locate data if it's lost from the main server.<br>- In this system, the developer gets a repository file that is present on the server. Along with this file, a copy of this is also stored in the developer’s system which is called a local repository.<br>- Due to this, the scalability of the project gets drastically improved.<br> </li>
<li>
<strong>Pull requests feature:</strong><br><br>- This feature helps in easier interaction amongst the developers of a team to coordinate merge-operations.<br>- It keeps a proper track of the changes done by developers to the code.<br> </li>
<li>
<strong>Effective release cycle:</strong><br><br>- Due to the presence of a wide variety of features, git helps to increase the speed of the release cycle and helps to improve the project workflow in an efficient manner.</li>

          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <ul>
<li>Have git installed in your system. </li>
<li>Then in order to create a git repository, create a folder for the project and then run <code>git init</code>. </li>
<li>Doing this will create a .git file in the project folder which indicates that the repository has been created.</li>

          <h3>13. Tell me something about git stash?</h3>
          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <p>Git stash can be used in cases where we need to switch in between branches and at the same time not wanting to lose edits in the current branch. Running the <code>git stash</code> command basically pushes the current working directory state and index to the stack for future use and thereby providing a clean working directory for other tasks.</p>

          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <ul>
<li>To delete a branch we can simply use the command <code>git branch –d [head]</code>.</li>
<li>To delete a branch locally, we can simply run the command: <code>git branch -d &lt;local_branch_name&gt;</code>
</li>
<li>To delete a branch remotely, run the command: <code>git push origin --delete &lt;remote_branch_name&gt;</code>
</li>
<li>Deleting a branching scenario occurs for multiple reasons. One such reason is to get rid of the feature branches once it has been merged into the development branch.</li>

<li>
<code>git stash apply</code> command is used for bringing the works back to the working directory from the stack where the changes were stashed using <code>git stash</code> command.</li>

          <h3>26. Explain the levels in git config and how can you configure values using them?</h3>
          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <ul><li>In order to make git work, it uses a set of configurations that are pre-defined by default by means of configuration files (or config files). We can change the default behavior of git by just modifying these files which are basically text files. In order to do this, it is important to understand how git identifies these files. It does so by following the below steps:<br><br>- Firstly, git searches for the config values in the system-wide gitconfig file stored in <code>&lt;&lt;installation_path&gt;&gt;/etc/gitconfig</code> file that has settings defined and applied to <strong>every user</strong> of the system and all their repos.<br>     - In case you want git to search from this particular file and read/write on it, we can pass the option <code>--system</code> to git config command.<br><br>- Next, git searches for the <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file or <code>~/.config/git/config</code> that has the scope specific to the user.<br>   - Git can be made to read/ write from this file specifically bypassing <code>--global</code> to the git config command.<br><br>- Lastly, git searches for the config values in the git directory of the local repository that we are currently working on.<br>   - These config values are specific to that particular repository alone and can be accessed by passing <code>--local</code> to the git config command.This is the default config file that gets accessed and modified upon in case we do not specify any levels.</li></ul>

          <h3>27. What is a detached HEAD and what causes this and how to avoid this?</h3>
          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <p>Detached HEAD indicates that the currently checked-out repository is not a local branch. This can be caused by the following scenarios:</p><ul>
<li>When a branch is a read-only branch and we try to create a commit to that branch, then the commits can be termed as “free-floating” commits not connected to any branch. They would be in a detached state.</li>
<li>When we checkout a tag or a specific commit and then we try to perform a new commit, then again the commits would not be connected to any branch. When we now try to checkout a branch, these new commits would be automatically placed at the top.<br><br>In order to ensure that detached state doesn't happen, =instead of checking out commit/tag, we can create a branch emanating from that commit and then we can switch to that newly created branch by using the command: <code>git checkout -b &lt;&lt;new_branch_name&gt;&gt;</code>. This ensures that a new branch is checkout out and not a commit/tag thereby ensuring that a detached state wouldn't happen.</li>

          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <ul><li>It is always advisable to create an additional commit rather than amending the existing commit due to the following reasons:<br>- Doing the amend operation destroys the previously saved state of that commit. If only the commit message gets changes or destroyed, it's acceptable but there might be cases when the contents of the commits get amended. This results in the loss of important information associated with the commit.<br>- Over usage of <code>git commit --amend</code> can have severe repercussions as the small commit amend can continue to grow and gather unrelated changes over time.</li></ul>

<li>
<strong>Approach 1</strong>: Fix the bad changes of the files and create a new commit and push to the remote repository. This step is the simplest and most recommended approach to fix bad changes. You can use the command: <code>git commit -m "&lt;message&gt;"</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Approach 2</strong>: New commit can be created that reverts changes done in the bad commit. It can be done using <code>git revert &lt;name of bad commit&gt;</code>

          <h3>36. What are the factors involved in considering which command to choose among: git merge and git rebase?</h3>
          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <p>Both these commands ensure that changes from one branch are integrated into another branch but in very different ways. Git rebasing can be thought of as saying to use another branch as a new base for the work.</p><ul>
<li>Whenever in doubt, it is always preferred to use the <code>git merge</code> command.<br><br>Following are some factors that tell when to use merge and rebase commands:<br> </li>
<li>In case our branch gets contributions from other developers outside the team as in open-source or public repositories, then rebase is not preferred.<br>- This is because rebase destroys the branch and it results in broken and inconsistent repositories unless the <code>git pull --rebase</code> command is used.</li>
<li>Rebase is a very destructive operation. If not applied correctly, it results in loss of committed work which might result in breaking the consistency of other developer’s contribution to the repository.</li>
<li>If the model of having branches per feature is followed, rebasing is not a good idea there because it keeps track of related commits done by the developers. But in case the team follows having branches per developer of the team, then the branch has no additional useful information to be conveyed. In this model, rebasing has no harm and can be used.</li>
<li>If there is any chance where there might be a necessity to revert a commit to previous commits, then reverting a rebase would be almost impossible as the commit data would be destroyed. In such cases, the merge can be used.</li>

<li>This can be a time-consuming process if we are not sure what to look at exactly. Fortunately, git provides a great search facility that works on the principle of binary search as <code>git-bisect</code> command.</li>
<li>The initial set up is as follows:</li>
</ul><pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs"> git bisect start         # initiates bisecting session
git bisect bad           # marks current revision as bad
git bisect good revision # marks last known commit as good revision</code></pre><ul><li>Upon running the above commands, git checks out a revision that is labeled as halfway between “good” and “bad” versions. This step can be run again by marking the commit as “good” or “bad” and the process continues until the commit which has a bug is found.</li></ul>
